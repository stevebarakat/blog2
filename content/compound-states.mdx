<div className="container">
In this lesson, we'll get familiar with compound (or parent/child) states. Compound states are states that contain other states. They are useful for organizing and structuring complex state machines. Compound states can have nested states, which can have their own nested states, and so on. This allows you to create a hierarchical structure of states that can represent complex behavior.

We'll also use a special kind of transition called a "delayed transition" to transition from one state to another after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for emulating the time it takes for a process to complete, such as a loading a media player.

Let's take a look at an example of a simple state machine with compound states (technically a statechart). This statechart represents an arcane technology called a CD player üòÅ, in which the CDs are placed in a tray and mechnically closed. It can be in one of three states:
- "Opened", "Closed", and "Closing".
- The "Closed" state is a parent state.
- It has three child states: "Stopped", "Playing", and "Paused".
- The "Closing" state transitions to the "Closed" state after 1500ms.

Here's the state machine modeled in Stately Studio:

  height="650px"
/>

<div className="container">

And here's the code in XState:
```ts
import { setup } from "xstate";

export const machine = setup({
  types: {
    context: {} as {},
    events: {} as
      | { type: "OPEN" }
      | { type: "PLAY" }
      | { type: "STOP" }
      | { type: "PAUSE" }
      | { type: "CLOSE" },
  },
}).createMachine({
  context: {},
  id: "Parent states",
  initial: "Opened",
  states: {
    Opened: {
      on: {
        CLOSE: {
          target: "Closing",
        },
      },
    },
    Closing: {
      after: {
        "1500": {
          target: "Closed",
        },
      },
    },
    Closed: {
      initial: "Stopped",
      on: {
        OPEN: {
          target: "Opened",
        },
      },
      states: {
        Stopped: {
          on: {
            PLAY: {
              target: "Playing",
            },
          },
        },
        Playing: {
          on: {
            PAUSE: {
              target: "Paused",
            },
            STOP: {
              target: "Stopped",
            },
          },
        },
        Paused: {
          on: {
            PLAY: {
              target: "Playing",
            },
            STOP: {
              target: "Stopped",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To use this machine in our React component, we'll use the `useMachine` hook again:

```tsx
import { machine } from "./machine";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

function App() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);
  const isPlaying = state.matches({ Closed: "Playing" });
  const isOpened = state.matches("Opened");
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{JSON.stringify(state.value)}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          send({
            type: isOpened ? "CLOSE" : "OPEN",
          })
        }
      >
        {isOpened ? "close" : "open"}
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          send({
            type: isPlaying ? "PAUSE" : "PLAY",
          })
        }
      >
        {isPlaying ? "pause" : "play"}
      </button>
      <button
        disabled={isOpened || !isPlaying}
        onClick={() => {
          send({ type: "STOP" });
        }}
      >
        stop
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

As you can see, we're using the `matches` method to check if the current state matches a specific state. This is useful for conditionally rendering UI elements based on the current state of the machine. We're also using the `after` property to transition to another state after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for modeling time-based behavior in your state machines. In this case, we're transitioning from the "Closing" state to the "Closed.Playing" state after 1500ms.

<div className="container">
Play around with the code above to see how the state machine transitions between states when the button is clicked. Here are some excercises to try:

<ul>
  <li>Change the name of the event to "toggle" and see how the machine behaves
  (make sure you do that in App.js and machine.ts).</li>

  <li>Change the name of the states to "Active" and "Inactive" and see how the machine behaves.</li>
</ul>
</div>


## Exercise
<div className="exercise">

<div className="instructions">
For this exercise, you will create a state machine that represents a coffee machine. The coffee machine has three states: "preparation", "brewing", and "ready". The "preparation" state is a parent state that has three child states: "idle", "weighed", and "ground". The "preparation" state transitions to the "brewing" state after the "ground" state. The "brewing" state transitions to the "ready" state after 3000ms. Here's the state machine defined in Stately:
