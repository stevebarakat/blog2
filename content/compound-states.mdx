title: Working with Compound States
abstract: In this lesson, we'll begin working with statecharts by using compound (or parent/child) states.

<div className="container">
In this lesson, we'll introduce compound (or parent/child) states. Compound states are states that contain other states. They are useful for organizing and structuring complex state machines. Compound states can have nested states, which can have their own nested states, and so on. This allows you to create a hierarchical structure of states that can represent complex behavior.

<div className="container">
In XState, a state machine is defined using a JSON-like object. Here's the same state machine defined in XState:

```ts
import { setup } from "xstate";

export const machine = setup({
  types: {
    events: {} as { type: "next" },
  },
}).createMachine({
  initial: "First State",
  states: {
    "First State": {
      on: {
        next: {
          target: "Second State",
        },
      },
    },
    "Second State": {
      on: {
        next: {
          target: "First State",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To use this machine in a React component, we can use the `useMachine` hook from `@xstate/react`:

```tsx
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";
import { machine } from "./machine";

function App() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);

  return (
    <>
      <p>{state.value}</p>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          send({
            type: "next",
          })
        }
      >
        next
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

As you can see we are using the `useMachine` hook to get the current `state` and the `send` function to dispatch events to the machine. When the button is clicked, the "next" event is sent to the machine, which transitions to the next state. The current state is displayed in a paragraph element. Below is the state machine in action:

</div>

<CodeEditor
  files={{
    starter: {
      "/App.js": {
        code: `import { machine } from "./machine";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

function App() {
const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);
return (

<>
  <p>{state.value}</p>
  <button
    onClick={() =>
      send({
        type: "next",
      })
    }
  >
    next
  </button>
</>
); }

export default App;`,
      },
      "/machine.ts": {
        code: `import { setup } from "xstate";

export const machine = setup({
  types: {
    events: {} as { type: "next" },
  },
}).createMachine({
  initial: "First State",
  states: {
    "First State": {
      on: {
        next: {
          target: "Second State",
        },
      },
    },
    "Second State": {
      on: {
        next: {
          target: "First State",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});`,
      },
    },
  }}
/>

<div className="container">
Play around with the code above to see how the state machine transitions between states when the button is clicked. Here are some excercises to try:

<ul>
  <li>Change the name of the event to "toggle" and see how the machine behaves
  (make sure you do that in App.js and machine.ts).</li>

  <li>Change the name of the states to "Active" and "Inactive" and see how the machine behaves.</li>
</ul>
</div>


## Exercise
<div className="exercise">

<div className="requirements">
For this exercise create a simple state machine that:

- Toggles between two states: "On" and "Off".
- The machine should have a single event called "switch" that toggles between the two states.
- The initial state should be "Off".
- The button text should display the current state of the machine.
</div>

  { starter: {
  "/App.js": {
    code: `function App() {
  return <button>current state goes here</button>;
}

export default App;

  "/machine.ts": {
    active: true,
    code: `import { setup } from "xstate";

export const machine = setup({

  initial: "",
  states: {},
});

    code: `import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

function App() {
const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);

<button
  onClick={() => {
    send({ type: "switch" });

  {state.value}
